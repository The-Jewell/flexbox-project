                <p>Why she deserves the throne: If any Targaryen is going to sit on the Iron Throne, the likeliest option seems to be Daenerys. She is the only surviving heir of Aerys Targaryen, who (you could argue) was unlawfully overthrown by Robert Baratheon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
               
                <p>Why he deserves the throne: As stated above, it seems pretty convincing that due to the way inheritance works in Westeros, Jon is the only son of the eldest son of the dead king, and therefore should be the ruler before Daenerys. If Jon had a son (uh, with someone other than Daenerys), then that child would be ruler in his stead before Daenerys. If he didn't have children and also died, then Daenerys would be the legitimate queen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                
                <p>Why she deserves the throne: To support Cersei's claim to the Iron Throne, you have to first believe that her husband, the "usurper" Robert Baratheon, was the rightful king of Westeros and that he launched a new dynasty after he ousted the Mad King, Aerys Targaryen, in the rebellion. When Robert overthrew the old ruler, in other words, the Targaryens ceased to have any claim to the throne. If so, her claim has to do with the fact that in Westeros, women do not inherit rule until the male line goes extinct. The Baratheon line of King Robert no longer exists; with no other legitimate claimants, the only option seems to be the queen dowager, Cersei.</p>
